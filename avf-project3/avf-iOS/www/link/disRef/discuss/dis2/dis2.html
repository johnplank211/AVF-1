				<p><b>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance</b></p>   
				 
				<p>By giving good direction with the use of language so the user(s) know how to maneuver throughout the app/webpage.
				Example: If I name a button that links to a twitter feed "button 1." The user(s) aren't going to have the slightest idea of where that button is linking to.</p>

				<p><b>2. Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</b></p>
				 
				<p>I think by knowing what the user(s) are going to be looking for within the app will help eliminate any frustration the user(s) would even have. So having links, headings, text and graphics already labeled around what the app is portraying in the first place would knock any confusion out of the way.</p>

				<p><b>3. Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</b></p>
				 
				<p>Apple has done a great job of adding accessibility support to their devices. iPad3 and iPhone 4S along with the 5 have come along way with the newest to the family. That being, Siri. Making user(s) experiences that much better with the option of actually having the devices give you information back after asking questions.<p>

				<p><b>4. Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p></b>
				 
				<p>1. Yelp: Helps users locate a variety of business in different locations.
				2. Pocket: Which use to be (Read it Later) is a app that saves things you have found on the web so you can go back and check it out later.<p>
