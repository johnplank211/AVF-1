				<dt><b>1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</b></dt>   
				<br> 
				<dd>Games at 61%</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>2. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</b></dt>
				<br> 
				<dd>Photography at 62.9%</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>3. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</b></dt>
				<br> 
				<dd>Messaging at 82.7%<dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>4. Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</b></dt>
				<br> 
				<dd>I would say that the percentage of people who use a smart phone use it as a source of entertainment. The U.S. use their devices as a source to play a game, Japan to take a photo, and Europe to stay in touch. All which are a prime example of entertainment.<dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>5. What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>It would seem as if Android users (30.19) is the leader when it comes to OS. iOS users (23.72%) is trailing right behind though. I think the impact isn't that severe. Most smartphones now days give you an alert telling you there is an update for your phone, and most people now days (in my opinion) try to stay up-to-date with the latest gadgets. So as far as impacting development, I don't think there is that much to worry about. Just don't forget to pay attention to your reviews when developing and after, and don't forget about those who are on later OS versions…… to an extent.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>6. What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>I struggled to find an average of the three markets. But I do believe it is all based on who your carrier is and what they may offer. I myself have the unlimited plan with Verizon wireless. I think some users may be limited with not having an unlimited plan as far as the amount of data they are able to use. But then again, anyone who has internet at home and has an option to connect to a wireless (which is anyone…. Starbucks offers free wifi. Go down the street if you can't find a hotspot around your house.) network has the ability to use up as much data as possible…. not limiting the user at all.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>7. And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>I don't think apps are chosen all on topic/genre. If you build an app that is appealing to the user and your ratings are high ( apple store, 5 star rating for example ), you will be successful with that app. I feel that if you create an app that is appealing, user friendly, you are paying attention to user feedback weekly, and make the changes that the users are asking for, you will be successful in any market. As far as the OS, I believe this all falls on user preference.</dd>
