				<dt><b>1. What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>Geolocation, accelerometer, notifications, contacts, camera.</dd> 
				<br>
				<dt><b>2. What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>Notifications, contacts, and possibly the camera function. My crud app is basically a portfolio, so with the use of the camera I can take pictures of projects I am working on. Contacts would be for people to get in touch with me, and notifications would be to alert me when people are “liking” the work I have done.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>3. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</b></dt>
				<br>
				<dd>I would like to have a fully functional “ demo app” by the end of this course.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>4. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</b></dt>
				<br>
 				<dd>“command s” has become my best friend over these months, along with remembering to commit/push to github. I use to find myself coding for hours without saving, or pushing. Luckily I have never had to “pay the price” (lost any work) for disregarding these actions.</dd>
